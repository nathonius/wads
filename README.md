# Wads by Nathonius

Various maps made by me for GZDoom.

## [BLEWIT.wad](./BLEWIT.wad)

My very first map, completed in December 2024 for the [Bluesky Map Jam](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/149523-bluesky-map-jam/). It's your average techbase map with gradually escalating arenas, only taking three minutes or so to complete.

Requires the [bsky.wad](./resources/bsky.wad) resource, or you can play it as part of the bluesky jam.

## [The Unhallowed Hallowed Halls - NTH01.wad](./NTH01.wad)

My second map, completed in June 2025 for [RAMP 2025](https://ramp2025.doomproject.com/). This one is a UAC base built into an ancient tomb, full of creepy skeletons and the like. I feel like it was a definite improvement over BLEWIT and used a number of new tricks like custom sprites and even a little zscript. I worked really hard to make the opening sections atmospheric to set the tone.

Requires the [RAMP resource pk3](./resources/ramp2024resources.pk3).
